# Getting started
To get started, just follow this tour though the app:
1. Select a folder, by pressing the "Select Folder" Button,
and open the folder you want to sort.

2. Look at the UI. You should see a couple of buttons: 
    * "Skip": Skips the current image and loads
    the next image.
    
       ![Screenshot showing the skip button](https://github.com/Lolle2000la/Image-Sort/blob/master/Image%20sort%20screenshots/Skip.png?raw=true)
    
        _Can be used by pressing the button 
        or the **left arrow key**._
    * "Move": Moves the current image to the 
    highlighted/selected folder in the list on the left
    side of the window.

        __You can select another folder just by
        clicking it or using the up and down keys to move the selection.__

       _To move an image, press the button or use the **right arrow key**._
    * "Go back": This is your best friend when you accidentally skipped
    or moved the current image. This will revert your last skip/move action.

        _Use it by pressing the button or the **control** key and the **left arrow key**
        at the same time._
    * "New Folder": Asks for the name for the new folder and creates that
    folder inside the current one.

        _Use it by pressing the **F3** button_
    * "Enter Folder": Enters the currently selected folder.

        _Use it by pressing the enter folder button, double clicking the folder you want to
        enter or by pressing the **Enter** key_
    * "Search": Located in the top of the window itself, this button toggles
        the search box on or off. Whenever search is on, selecting a folder from
        the list and skipping/moving the current image is not possible, so
        remember to turn it off before you continue.

        _Use it by pressing the button or the *control* key and the *s* key at the same time._
    * "Horizontal Resolution": Sets the horizontal resolution, with which the images should get
        get loaded. Lower -> Faster loading times, Higher -> more quality. Once focused, press
        enter on your keyboard to apply your changes (if you made any).

        _Use it by clicking the link or by pressing the **F5** key._
    * A slider indicating your progress: This slider can be used to go through the images you have
        and jump to a specific one.

        _Use it by dragging the slider._
3. Now try out all those features. Try doing all this stuff with the keyboard only. Once you are good,
close this Window and come back to it later on if you need to. You can open it, by pressing the "Help"
 button or the **F1** key.

That's it. Now you are ready to sort all your folders.
