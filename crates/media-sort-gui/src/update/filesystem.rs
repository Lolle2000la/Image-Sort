//! Routing of filesystem watcher events into media grid and folder tree
//! refreshes.
//!
//! Two refresh pipelines are driven from here, both coalescing and both
//! non-blocking:
//!
//! - **Media grid** — events whose parent is the current folder trigger
//!   [`AppState::start_media_refresh`], a replace-mode background rescan
//!   that keeps the current entries visible until the new list lands.
//! - **Folder tree** — events that change the children of any displayed
//!   folder (a subfolder added/removed/renamed inside the current folder or
//!   an expanded node) trigger [`AppState::request_folder_tree_refresh`],
//!   a background tree rebuild that preserves expansion state.
//!
//! Directory-level `Modified` events (the OS only telling us "this
//! directory changed", not which children) trigger the same refreshes.
//! This matters most on macOS, whose kqueue backend (workspace
//! `macos_kqueue` feature) under-reports children: it reports only the
//! first not-yet-known entry per directory-write reap and never reports
//! deletions of pre-existing files, emitting a directory `Modified`
//! instead. Treating every batch as "something changed, re-scan" (full
//! replace-mode rescan, never a partial diff) makes the grid
//! self-correcting on every backend.
//!
//! Special cases: the current folder itself renamed externally is
//! followed (the app re-opens the new path) where the backend can pair
//! the rename (inotify, with the parent watched); where it cannot
//! (Windows/macOS deliver the two sides separately), the view moves up
//! to the closest existing ancestor like a plain deletion. The current
//! folder deleted externally always moves the view up to the closest
//! existing ancestor.
