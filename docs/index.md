## A quick description
Image sort is an open source app that lets you sort your folders in an fast fashion. It let's you select an folder and move the images around as you like. You get one image after another and the choice to move it to one of the subfolders (or the hostfolder, that means the folder containing the currently selected folder) or skip it. You can also revert your last action (skip/move).

## Why Image sort?
* It's tiny (around 3MB)
* It's fast
* It's completely controllable via keyboard, with a one-click shortcut for nearly anything. Read the [help](help.md) for more details.

## Install
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Lolle2000la/Image-Sort/releases) page, and download and run the installer of the newest version. Then follow the instructions in the installer.

## Updating
Image sort includes an updater that checks for updates every time the apps runs. When a new version is available, it will ask you if you want to do the update. If yes, the updater will close the app and run the update. Once finished, you can start the app again.
