# userspace from the `gpu-2404` content provider rather than shipping it (see
# AGENTS.md). Needs sudo to install the snap and that provider.
#
# Called both by `.github/workflows/snap.yml` (the recipe check) and by
# `.github/workflows/snap-release.yml` (which must not publish a snap that fails
# it), so it lives here rather than inline in either workflow.
